My personal linux configurations and knowledge about plugins and other things that I'm using 

# Programming Environment

Now I'm experimenting with [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) which is very simmilar with spacemacs but lighter and more responsive.
Also it has better thought out keyboard shortcuts.

## Shell and its plugins
Fish isn't the quickest and lightest shell but it has everything that I need pretty much out of the box.

- [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com) - Fish Shell Website
- [Fish Shelly](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) - GitHub repository
- [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) - Fish Shell plugin manager
- [Async Prompt](https://github.com/acomagu/fish-async-prompt) - Make your prompt asynchronous!
